    <h2>My suggestion on how to create seemingly random, easy to remember passwords.</h2>
    <h3>A little history of my passwords.</h3>
    <p>I have administrator access to a large corporation’s network.
      I currently have at least 8 different work related account that need passwords.</p>
    <p>I got tired of trying to find new password every 60 days.
      I do not want to write my passwords down.
      I needed a clue I could write down.
      That clue needed to have meaning only to me.
      My favorite example, had a clue of “trees”.
      The password was “P9awm2caB”.
      That was for the trees around my house: 9 Pines. Apple, Willow, Maple, 2 Cherry, Aspin and a Birch.</p>
    <p>Over the years, it became harder to come up with good Clue/Password combos.
      I finally came up with the idea of patterns.
      All I would have to write down is a reference letter and the number of the pattern I used.
      A clue of “d1y3” could be for the password “esXcfyUi7j”. <i>See patterns below.</i>
      When I need a new password, I just choose a new reference letter for each pattern.
      Maybe “s1k3” which becames “waZxdkL;p>”.
      They look random, but they hold meaning to me.
      All I have to remember is a few patterns.
      I do not need a new pattern every time I needed to change my password.
      Every once in a while, I will stop using one pattern and start a new one.</p>

    <h2>Creating Patterns.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Define a grid representing your keyboard. I use the grid below.</li>
      <li>Each pattern should consist of 3-5 presses.</li>
      <li>Decide where the reference character is on the pattern. Is it one of the presses or not? In Pattern 1 the zero represents an un-pressed reference key. Otherwise use press 1 as the reference.</li>
      <li>Decide and mark which press or presses will be shifted. The bold numbers represent shifted presses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Additional options.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patterns could be split. Meaning after a certain key press you insert the next pattern. See pattern 2 press 2. You would make presses 1 and 2. Do the next pattern. Finish with presses 3, 4 and 5.</li>
      <li>One or more presses could change. i.e. in pattern 1 the whole pattern could rotate around the reference key.</li>
      <li>A press could be a particular key. i.e. the fourth press of the pattern is always the ‘z’ key.</li>
    </ul>
